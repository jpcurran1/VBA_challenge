For this assignment I created three macros to populate four new columns on the stock market data excel file. The first macro "Ticker Value" runs and gets you all the unique ticker values in the list. The second macro "Yearly Change" takes the difference between the first opening price of each unique ticker and the last closing price of each ticker to get the total change column value. It also takes that number as a percent change to populate the % change column. Lastly, the third macro total count takes the last row of values in the raw data and totals all of those for each unique ticker. This gets the total volume of stocks traded.

The last part of this assignment was to use conitional formatting on the yearly change. For each stock that had a positive change I have highlighted green and for each with a negative change I have highlighted red.
